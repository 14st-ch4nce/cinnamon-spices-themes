{"author": "abnvolk", "name": "Adwaita Classic", "description": "<p>\n A theme inspired by Adwaita GNOME Shell theme by half-left:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://half-left.deviantart.com/gallery/26559426#/d4kxqq4\">http://half-left.deviantart.com/gallery/26559426#/d4kxqq4</a>, but modified to match the GNOME Classic look (black panel etc.). I added workspace buttons from my Elementary Luna Mod theme, because I don&#39;t know how they should look :))</p>\n<p>\n This theme uses Cantarell, the default GNOME font. If it is not installed on your computer (seems that it&#39;s the case with Mint), modify cinnamon.css, or install the package cantarell-fonts (for Ubuntu-based distros).</p>\n"}
