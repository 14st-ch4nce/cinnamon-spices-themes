install to ~/.themes and select from cinnamon settings/themes/transparent

I made this cinnamon theme so I could use Cairo dock and cinnamon, taking up only one side of the screen.  The lower part of Cairo dock overlapped by cinnamon is dead space as a result, but other than that it works just how I want.  The sysmon in thumbnail.png is gkrellm with its transparent skin, invisible-black.

I put only programs in cairo dock and only applet-type thingies in cinnamon so that whatever programs I am working on take up the big space in the dock with no distractions.

enjoy!

If you like the theme, listen to my music at http://way.net/waymusic (most everything, with a popout player to run in the background), my current stuff (always sound related, sometimes leaves the domain of music) at http://way.net/waymusic, and my experimental improv duo with Eric Parker, rreplay, and its album, rrepertoire which can be downloaded free or bought from cdbaby, amazon, or itunes to show the love:).
