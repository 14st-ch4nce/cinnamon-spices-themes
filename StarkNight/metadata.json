So by default the panel Height is set to 33px.&nbsp; However this creates a small side affect, you wont be able to slide your mouse along the very bottom of the screen to select an item.&nbsp; You will need to be a few pixels above.&nbsp; This doesn&#39;t bother me at all, but I know it might bother others.&nbsp; So if that is the case for you then you can change the Panel Settings and force set the Panel hieght to 30px.</p>\n"}
