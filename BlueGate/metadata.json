{"author": "connerh", "name": "BlueGate", "description": "<p>\n This is my first Cinnamon theme. It is based on the Baldr theme originally, but is meant to give a little more color overall. If there are components that I&#39;ve missed please let me know. This theme is designed with only a single panel at the bottom in mind.</p>\n<p>\n I have included the blue Mint icon in the theme download, so if you want to use it set your menu icon path to &quot;/home/[username]/.themes/BlueGate/cinnamon/menu.png&quot;</p>\n<p>\n [Update Oct 18, 2014]</p>\n<p>\n Reduced the size of some of the shadows, reduced menu padding, and made some of the rounding and shading more subtle.</p>\n"}
