To set your default icon theme for all of the applications go to:

/home/"My-UserName"/.icons/default

Then open the index.theme file and replace the line that says:
[Icon Theme]
Inherits="My-Icon-Theme-Name"

(Rplace whatever is with the " ")

To change the menu icon just right click (or secondary click if you are left handed) on the menu then choose configure & then you will see an option to set the image for the menu just navigate to the folder where the theme was installed, in most cases is on:
/home/"My-UserName"/.themes/

Wallpapers & sounds are included to make the theme complete, for example you can also replace the sound for the opening & closing windows, just go to System Settings > Sounds > Sound Effects & use the one that you prefere.
