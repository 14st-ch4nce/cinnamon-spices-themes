{"author": "petrucci4prez", "name": "CinnXP-Royale", "description": "<p>\n For all those liking this venerable almost-decade-and-a-half-old interface, here is another WinXP clone :)<br />\n <br />\n This the <strong>Royale</strong> flavor; I also maintain the <strong>Luna</strong> flavor<br />\n <br />\n Based on Mint-XP (fmcgorenc) and Adwaita<br />\n <br />\n Includes <strong>cinnamon</strong>, <strong>gtk2</strong>, <strong>gtk3</strong>, <strong>metacity</strong>, and <strong>cursor</strong> themes (all optimized to run on <strong>Linux Mint 17.x</strong>)<br />\n <br />\n See README on github for install instructions<br />\n <br />\n NOTE: To fully use this theme it must be manually installed. Please do not try to install from within Linux Mint (using Settings&gt;Themes&gt;Desktop&gt;Add/Remove Desktop Themes&gt;Available Themes (online)). The Mint auto-installer does not know how to deal with icon files so theme will not fully install with this method.<br />\n <br />\n <u><strong>Changelog:</strong></u><br />\n <br />\n v1.0.2 - optimizations, split from the original luna theme (04-22-2016)</p>\n"}
