### General Information:

	The Cinnamon theme has been updated to be compatable with 
	Cinnamon 2.8.6 and has been indexed for those who wish to tweak .CSS

	The Cinnamon theme and GTK 2.0 contain all SVG pixmaps, which may 
	cause slowness on older machines or those with limited resources, 
	but provide greater clarity in most cases.
	
	I have endeavored to make these instructions easy if you are new to 
	Linux and avoid using the CLI as much as possible. At the end  of 
	this document are a few CLI commands that are useful to some degree.
	If you are an experienced Linux user you probably won't find any 
	revelations in this file. So, without further ado, on with the show.
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	 
	Obviously if you are reading this you have already extracted all the
	files in the .tar.gz file; in it you will find the following folders:
	
	1. 	Arcturus Cairo-clock
	
	2. 	Silver Cinnamon desktop
			
	3. 	GTK-2.0 
	
	4. 	GTK-3
			
	5.	Silver Metacity
			
	6.	Silver GDM
					
	7. Black-Diamonds animated cursors 
	
	8. Frankula conky
	
	9. Original wallpaper
	
	10. README
	
	
		
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	You will need to create the following folders if they do not exist 
	already:
	
					.icons
					.fonts
					.themes
					
	go to HOME and right-click and select: create new folder and make 
	certain the "." is included in the name.
					
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Place the Black Diamond 4.2 folder with the Cinnamon, Metacity, 
	GTK-2.0, GTK-3.0, and GDM folders in the .themes folder you created 
	and your themes manager should recognize them without any further 
	work. The Cursors and Icons go in the .icon folder, and font, of 
	course goes in the .font folder. If you wish to use any of the extra 
	metacity themes you need to place them separately in the .themes 
	folder. The Plymouth logo, Conky, and wallpapers can go anywhere in
	the home folder. 
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	You can use any font you wish, however you will need the Xirod font 
	and Webdings font to make the suite display as intended.
	If you do not have these fonts, they are available at:
	
		http://www.dafont.com/xirod.font
	
	And in a terminal type or paste:
	
		sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer  
	
	 Place the downloaded font in the .fonts folder you already created.
	 The other fonts will be added through the terminal and nothing else
	 needs to be done manually.
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	To add the GDM spash screen in Linux Mint add it to the MDM list 
    from the .themes folder (the file must be compressed as a .tar.gz 
    file to work so don't extract the file unless you choose to modify 
    it). 
    
   	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	To install the cairo-clock:
	
					sudo apt-get install cairo-clock
	
	You can place this file anywhere, but if you have problems 
	displaying the clock, then open as root 
			
				usr/share/cairo-clock/themes
				
	and place the folder there. If it still doesn't work go back and 
	open the clock of your choice and delete its contents and replace it
	with the individual files of clock provided. Make certain to copy 
	and paste them, not drag them. For some reason, (at least for me), I
	have found this fix doesn't work if the files are dragged into the 
	folder. 
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------   
    
    Included with the Conky is a detailed README for its installation.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
   
    The following hints may be considered common knowledge by experienced
    Linux users; however they may be helpful to someone new to using it, 
    and may encourage them to use the command line interface, so I have
    included them.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To add the pulse audio repository:
    
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8; sudo apt-get update -y; sudo apt-get install -y pulseaudio-equalizer; mkdir -p ~/.pulse/presets; pulseaudio-equalizer-gtk
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    To add Googleearth with Panaramio in GTK-2:
    
    sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 lsb-core
	wget -O google-earth64.deb http://drive.noobslab.com/data/apps/google-earth/google-earth_amd64.deb
	sudo dpkg -i google-earth64.deb
	sudo apt-get install libfreeimage3
	cd /opt/google/earth/free
	sudo wget https://googledrive.com/host/0B2F__nkihfiNalQzN0ZmcjBPTGs/ge7.1.1.1580-0.x86_64-new-qt-libs-debian7-ubuntu12.tar.xz

	sudo apt-get install gufw
	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few good programs:
    
    sudo apt-get install codeblocks
	sudo apt-get install gcolor2
	sudo apt-get install inkscape
	sudo apt-get install blender
	sudo apt-get install makehuman
	sudo apt-get install cairo-clock

    Check for bad blocks, and know the health of your HDD; Warning: this 
    takes time.
    
    sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda1
    
    If your HDD has a different name, or you want to check many 
    partitions, change sda1 to whatever the name is of one that you want 
    to check.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    For securitys sake:
    
    (To update your Open SSL run these commands; change: openssl-1.0.2g 
    to whatever the current version is.) 
    
    cd /usr/src
	sudo wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz -O openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz
	sudo tar -zxf openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz
	cd openssl-1.0.2g
	sudo ./config
	sudo make
	sudo make test
	sudo make install
	sudo mv /usr/bin/openssl /root/
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl /usr/bin/openssl
	openssl version
	env check='Not vulnerable' x='() { :;}; check=Vulnerable' bash -c 'echo $check'

    --------------------------------------------------------------------   
    These next two tips are added just because I had to search a lot
    to find them and thought they might be useful:
    	
	To make screenshots of your MDM screen: edit "/etc/mdm/Init/Default"
	 and add:
	 
					( gnome-screenshot -d 5) &
	
	before the line with "exit 0"
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To change GDM background user color (in Linux Mint) go to: 
                     
                     user/share/mdm/distro.conf  
                     
    file and change line 5 (GTKTheme=) to what ever other GTK theme you 
    want and it will change the color of the GDM user color to match it.   
       
  --------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
	To adjust the area of the window previews, go to:
  
		/usr/share/cinnamon/applets/windowlist@cinnamon.org
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Miscellaneous things:
    
    Know all your O/S & hardware:
