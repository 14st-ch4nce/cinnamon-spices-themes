### General Information:

	You can use any font you wish, however you will need the Xirod font 
	to make the conky display as intended.
	If you do not have this font, it is available at:
	
	http://www.dafont.com/xirod.font
	
	To install additional fonts, such as webdings, ( you will have to,
	or you will get square boxes where it is used), open a terminal and 
	type or paste:
	
	sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer  
	
	If you don't have a .fonts folder, simply make one and place it in 
	your home folder. Make certain to make it a .font not a font folder
	as it needs the dot to be recognized by the system and make it 
	hidden.                   
	                                                                  ##

### CONKY INSTALLATION ###

    Step 1
### Download Conky-all from either the repository:
 
	(sudo apt-get install conky-all)

	or Source Forge if you haven't already and install it. 
	After installation, the stock conky will start. Open a terminal and 
	type or past:
	 
							killall conky 
							
    This will terminate the process and allow you to proceed to step 2         
                                                                      ##

    Step 2
### Un-tar (extract) the Frankula Conky tar.gz; then either drag or copy
	the .conkyrc to your home folder. In the terminal type or paste: 
							
							conky &
							
	This will start-up the new conky.
	Do not use uppercase letters for the commands, only for the "&"
	symbol, as they will not be	recognized by the system.
	To stop and restart conky in a single command, type or paste in a 
	terminal:
	
						killall -SIGUSR1 conky
						             
	For conky to begin at start up in Linux Mint, open the system 
	manager and then open start up programs. Click "add" then in the 
	start up command type or paste: 
	
	                             conky                       
	
	It helps to give it a few seconds delay in the start up time 
	section too.                                                      ##

    Step 3
### To set the weather to your locale, simply Google, Yahoo Weather, 
    (now there's irony), and select "Detect My Location" from the left 
    hand menu, and allow it to. Then you only need to copy and paste 
    the digits at the end of the URL in the search bar into line below 
    in the .conkyrc replacing the 2408784                             
    
    ${voffset -8}${execi 300 curl -s "http://weather.yahooapis.com/fore
    castrss?w=2408784&u=f" -o ~/.cache/weather.xml} 
              ^^^^^^^
              ^ HERE ^                                                ##              
    
	Step 4
###	First, in a terminal for the HDD temperature:
		
		$ sudo apt-get install hddtemp
		
	Then, after installation to configure HDD temp you must do the 
	following which will allow conky to access it without having to 
	access it with a root password, type or paste:
	
					sudo dpkg-reconfigure hddtemp
					
	1. Answer No to the first question and YES to all subsequent 
	   questions making sure not to allow external access
	to your ports, only internal.
	(NOTE) If you use rkhunter or chkrootkit, these programs will give a 
	false-positive as it will show up as an unknown root permission.
	                                                                  ##
	
	Step 5
###	To enable core temp, open a terminal and type or paste:

				$ sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
				                                                      ##    
 
	Step 6
### Install CURL, this enables the weather report, and some other things
	that you may install such as RSS feeds.
			
				$ sudo apt-get install curl
													                  ##

### CONKY ADJUSTMENTS ###
 
### To add or remove a transparent backgound to the conky, open the 
    .conkyrc with a text editor and change "own_window_transparent yes "
    to "no"                                                          ##

### To make the background vary from transparent to opaque,change
    "own_window_argb_value 155"
    to any number between 1 (near complete transparency) and 255 
    (completely opaque). Changing the xftalpha number from 0.1 - 1 will
    alter how well the text in conky is seen, and make it more or less
    transparent, too, it can be adjusted in tenths, i.e.: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
    , etc., up to a value of 1.0, the most transparent.               ##
    
### Below is a list of some RSS newsfeeds for convenience, or you can 
	use any other you may wish. Just paste your choice into the 
	following line in the .conkyrc file:
	
	${color3}${font DejaVu Sans Condensed:size=8}${scroll 44${rss 
	http://feeds.abcnews.com/abcnews/topstories 15 item_titles 12}|}
	
	Make certain not to remove the "${rss" that is just before the 
	"HTTP" or the "15 item_titles 12}|}" that is at the end. The former 
	commands the feed, and the latter adjusts the update time 
	(15 minutes)and amount of headlines (12 headlines). These can be
	adjusted according to preference, but be warned you will tax your
	system if you update more often than the default 15 minutes.

###	To set the Network graph perameters simply take your ISP's download
	speed in Megabites and multiply by 1024 (to get KiB per second)and 
	insert the numbers in the following line in the .conkyrc:
	(You can do the same proceedure for upload speed.)
	
	   ${voffset -2}${color}${font webdings:size=14}6${font}${downspeed 
	   wlan0}/s${alignr}${downspeedgraph wlan0 26,150 ffffff 000000 
	   17578KiB -l -t}                                               
	   ^ HERE ^                                                	      ##

### You can tag along extra text in the Scroll line, (the last line in 
	the .conkyrc), such as quotes, jokes, or anything you like, or 
	change it completely if you want.                   			  
	If you add anything past the scroll line you must place a "|" symbol
	at the end, or whatever you place after it will scroll also.      ##
	
###	Changing colors is easy with a couple of easily downloaded programs.
	Gcolor2 and Geany are the perfect tools to easily swap out the 
	colors. Geany will find any bit of text you are searching for, so if
	there are a lot of things you want to change, it will make seaching 
	and making repetitious cutting and pasting of hexidecimal code easy. 
	Gcolor2 will provide you with the 6 digit / hex code for any of the 
	16 million colors you might desire. Both programs are avialable in
	the repository. 
	
	Though this conky is white and gray, it has also been set up with 
	some pre-set color sets in the configuration section of the .conkyrc
	file to make it easier to change the colors, you only need to change
	hexidecimals that are in the .conkyrc here:
	
	# Default colors and also border colors
	default_color 707070
	color1 e6e6e6
	color2 cccccc
	color3 ff0000
	color4 b3b3b3
	color5 ffffff
	color6 8c8c8c
	
	Example: change ffffff to FF0000 and it will change from White to 
	Red
	
	And all colors tagged in the TEXT section will change 
	correspondingly, though some colors in the CPU client
	section will need to be changed individually.					  ##
	
###	To change the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, remove the
	temperature_unit fahrenheit text from the Conky and it will default
	back to Celsius.                                                  ##
