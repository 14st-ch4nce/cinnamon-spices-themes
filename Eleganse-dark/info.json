Usually update the theme only when it became incompatible with new version Cinnamon (means I didn&#39;t do anything on this for months) <img alt=\"cool\" src=\"http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/shades_smile.gif\" title=\"cool\" />.</p>\n<p>\n Last update (19 Dec 2016): To make compatable with new (Cinnamon 3.2) arrow less menu</p>\n"}
