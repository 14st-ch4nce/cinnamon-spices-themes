If any part of Color UI has any problems in any of the things I listed as this theme supporting, please notify me in the comments and I will try to fix it ASAP! Feedback is always appreciated, if it was not for feedback how else would Color UI improve.</span></p>\n<p>\n The wallpaper used in the screenshot could be downloaded from here -&gt;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, 'Bitstream Vera Sans', Arial, Helvetica, Sans, 'Bitstream Vera Serif';\"><u>samuelfur.deviantart.com/art/Pen-Tool-Wallpaper-449831439</u> !</span></span></p>\n<p>\n This will only download the cinnamon part of this theme, to get the full theme, follow this link -&gt;<u> http://opendesktop.org/content/show.php?content=168876</u> !</p>\n"}
