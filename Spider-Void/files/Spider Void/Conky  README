############################### READ ME ################################

### This README was written with the "new to Linux" person in mind. I
	personally use Linux Mint, and this conky is geared towards that
	distro, though it will work on all other Linux distro's too.
	I have attempted to put as much detail into this README as
	possible to assist with the installation of your download, without
	making it seem too complicated, however, it is a work in progress.
	For those of you who are new to this I hope this helps...         ##

### CONKY INSTALLATION ###

    Step 1
### Download Conky-all from either the repository, or Source Forge     
    if you haven't already and install it. After installation, open a 
    terminal and type or past: 
							killall conky 
    This will terminate the process and allow you to proceed to step 2         
                                                                      ##

    Step 2
### Un-tar (extract) the Frankula Conky tar.gz; then either drag or copy
	the .conkyrc to your home folder. In the terminal type or paste: 
							conky &
	This will start-up the new conky.
	Do not use uppercase letters for the commands, only for the "&"
	symbol, as they will not be	recognized by the system.
	To stop and restart conky in a single command, type or paste in a 
	terminal:
	
						killall -SIGUSR1 conky
						             
	For conky to begin at start up in Linux Mint, open the system 
	manager and then open start up programs. Click "add" then in the 
	start up command type or paste: 
	
	                             conky                       
	
	It helps to give it a few seconds delay in the start up time 
	section too.                                                      ##

    Step 3
### To set the weather to your locale, simply Google, Yahoo Weather, 
    (now there's irony), and select "Detect My Location" from the left 
    hand menu, and allow it to. Then you only need to copy and paste 
    the digits at the end of the URL in the search bar into line below 
    in the .conkyrc replacing the 2408784                             
    
    ${voffset -8}${execi 300 curl -s "http://weather.yahooapis.com/fore
    castrss?w=2408784&u=f" -o ~/.cache/weather.xml} 
              ^^^^^^^
              ^ HERE ^                                                ##              
    
	Step 4
###	First, in a terminal:
		
		$ sudo apt-get install hddtemp
		
	Then, after installation to configure HDD temp you must do the 
	following which will allow conky to access it without having to 
	access it with a root password:
	1. sudo dpkg-reconfigure hddtemp
	2. Answer YES
	3. Duration Screen - set to 1 second or 0, whichever you like
	4.Answer yes to all else, making sure not to allow external access
	to your ports, only internal.
	(NOTE) If you use rkhunter or chkrootkit, these programs will give a 
	false-positive because it will show up as an unknown root permission.
	                                                                  ##
	
	Step 5
###	To enable core temp, open a terminal and type or paste:

				$ sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
				                                                      ##    
 
	Step 6
### Install CURL, this enables the weather report, and some other things
	that you may install in the future such as RSS feeds.
			
				$ sudo apt-get install curl
													                  ##
### FONTS ###

### You will need the Xirod font to make the theme display correctly. If
	you do not have this font, it is available at:
	
	http://www.dafont.com/xirod.font
	
	To install the webdings font for the conky, 
	open a terminal	and type or paste:
	
	sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer  
	
	If you don't have a .fonts folder, simply make one and place it in 
	your home folder. Make certain to make it a .font not a font folder
	as it needs this to be recognized by the system and make it hidden.                   
	                                                                  ##
### CONKY ADJUSTMENTS ###
 
### To remove the frame around the vertical conky, simply delete the 
	first line after the TEXT, of move it to above the text for later 
	use                                                               ##

### To remove the transparent backgound of the conky, open the 
    .conkyrc with a text editor and change "own_window_transparent no "
    to "yes"                                                          ##

### To make the background vary from transparent to opaque,change
    "own_window_argb_value 155"
    to any number between 1 (near complete transparency) and 255 
    (completely opaque). Changing the xftalpha number from 0 - 1 will
    alter how well the text in conky is seen, and make it more or less
    transparent, too, it can be adjusted in tenths, i.e.: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
    , etc., up to a value of 1.0 .                                    ##
    
### Below is a list of some RSS newsfeeds for convenience, or you can 
	use any other you may wish. Just paste your choice into the 
	following line in the .conkyrc file:
	
	${color3}${font DejaVu Sans Condensed:size=8}${scroll 44${rss 
	http://feeds.abcnews.com/abcnews/topstories 15 item_titles 12}|}
	
	Make certain not to remove the "${rss" that is just before the 
	"HTTP" or the "15 item_titles 12}|}" that is at the end. The former 
	commands the feed, and the latter adjusts the update time 
	(15 minutes)and amount of headlines (12 headlines). These can be
	adjusted according to preference, but be warned you will tax your
	system if you update more often than the default 15 minutes.

###	To set the Network graph perameters simply take your ISP's download
	speed in Megabites and multiply by 1024 (to get KiB per second)and 
	insert the numbers in the following line in the .conkyrc:
	(You can do the same proceedure for upload speed.)
	
	   ${voffset -2}${color}${font webdings:size=14}6${font}${downspeed 
	   wlan0}/s${alignr}${downspeedgraph wlan0 26,150 ffffff 1A1A1A 
	   65000KiB -l -t}                                               
	   ^ HERE ^                                                	      ##

### You can tag along extra text in the Scroll line, (the last line in 
	the .conkyrc), such as quotes, jokes, or anything you like, or 
	change it completely if you want.                   			  
	If you add anything past the scroll line you must place a "|" symbol
	at the end, or whatever you place after it will scroll also.      ##
	
### To use the framed conky, place the .pix folder in home, and remove 
	the .conkyrc, as they must be in seperate places to work.         ##
	
###	Changing colors is easy with a couple of easily downloaded programs.
	Gcolor2 and Geany are the perfect tools to easily swap out the 
	colors. Geany will find any bit of text you are searching for 
	making repetitious cutting and pasting of hexidecimal code easy and 
	Gcolor2 will provide you with the 6 digit / hex code for any of the 
	16 million colors you might desire. Both programs are avialable in
	the repository. The conky has also been set up with some pre-set
	colors in the configuration section of the .conkyrc file to make it 
	easier to change the colors. One needs to only change the here:
	
	# Default colors and also border colors
	default_color 00BD00
	color1 C2A827
	color2 00FF00
	color3 E6DC2C
	color4 006600 
	
	And all colors tagged in the TEXT section will change 
	correspondingly.												  ##
	
###	To change the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, remove the
	temperature_unit fahrenheit text from the Conky and it will default
	back to Celsius.                                                  ##
	
### To use the framed conky, simply place the .pix folder in home and 
	remove the .conkyrc file to outside the .pix folder.              ##
	
### Conky is super easy to alter. or add new things to. 
	It is near pure function with little form. Conky with lua is 
	beautiful and adds the form to the function, though it is more 
	complicated to deal with. Some good sources for conky knowledge are:
	
	http://conky.sourceforge.net/variables.html
	
	http://conky.sourceforge.net/docs.html
	 
	http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html
	
	If you have any problems with installation or performance, feel free
	to contact me directly through my profile at Gnome-look.org or 
	Linuxmint-art.org or leave a suggestion in the comments section and 
	I will address your	concerns as soon as possible. As someone once
	told me, 
	         "If you can Google, you can do Linux"...                 ##
