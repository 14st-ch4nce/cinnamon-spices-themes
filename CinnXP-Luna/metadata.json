Please do not try to install from within Linux Mint (using Settings&gt;Themes&gt;Desktop&gt;Add/Remove Desktop Themes&gt;Available Themes (online)). The Mint auto-installer does not know how to deal with icon files so theme will not fully install with this method.</p>\n<p>\n <u><strong>Changelog:</strong></u></p>\n<p>\n v0.1 - Initial Release</p>\n<p>\n v1.0 - Updated for Cinnamon 2.8</p>\n<p>\n v1.0.1 - bug fixes and added support for gtk-3.10</p>\n<p>\n v1.0.2 - optimizations, split into royale theme (04-22-2016)</p>\n"}
