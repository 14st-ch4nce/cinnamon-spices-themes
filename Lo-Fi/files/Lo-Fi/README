### General Information:

	The Cinnamon theme has been updated to be compatable with 
	Cinnamon 2.8.6 and has been indexed for those who wish to tweak .CSS

	The Cinnamon theme and GTK 2.0 contain all SVG pixmaps, which may 
	cause slowness on older machines or those with limited resources, 
	but provide greater clarity in most cases.
	
	I have endeavored to make these instructions easy if you are new to 
	Linux and avoid using the CLI as much as possible. At the end  of 
	this document are a few CLI commands that are useful to some degree.
	If you are an experienced Linux user you probably won't find any 
	revelations in this file. So, without further ado, on with the show.
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	 
	Obviously if you are reading this you have already extracted all the
	files in the .tar.gz file; in it you will find the following folders:
	
	1. 	Lo-Fi pack 
		{	Lo-Fi Cinnamon desktop x 4 = void panel and straight panel 
			in both glass and opaque.
			Lo_Fi Metacity	}
	
	2.	Set of original wallpapers
			
	3. 	this README
	
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	You will need to create the following folders if they do not exist 
	already:
	
					.icons
					.fonts
					.themes
					
	go to HOME and right-click and select: create new folder and make 
	certain the "." is included in the name.
					
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Place the Lo-Fi folder with the Cinnamon, Metacity, .themes folder 
	you created and your themes manager should recognize them without 
	any further work and wallpapers can go anywhere in the home folder. 
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	You can use any font you wish, however you will need the Xirod font 
	and Webdings font to make the theme display as intended.
	If you do not have these fonts, they are available at:
	
		http://www.dafont.com/xirod.font
	
	And in a terminal type or paste:
	
		sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer  
	
	 Place the downloaded font in the .fonts folder you already created.
	 The other fonts will be added through the terminal and nothing else
	 needs to be done manually.
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The following hints may be considered common knowledge by experienced
    Linux users; however they may be helpful to someone new to using it, 
    and may encourage them to use the command line interface, so I have
    included them.

    Check for bad blocks, and know the health of your HDD; Warning: this 
    takes time.
    
    sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda1
    
    If your HDD has a different name, or you want to check many 
    partitions, change sda1 to whatever the name is of one that you want 
    to check.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    For securitys sake:
    
    (To update your Open SSL run these commands; change: openssl-1.0.2g 
    to whatever the current version is.) 
    
    cd /usr/src
	sudo wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz -O openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz
	sudo tar -zxf openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz

	sudo ./config
	sudo make
	sudo make test
	sudo make install
	sudo mv /usr/bin/openssl /root/
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl /usr/bin/openssl
	openssl version
	env check='Not vulnerable' x='() { :;}; check=Vulnerable' bash -c 'echo $check'

    --------------------------------------------------------------------   
    These next three tips are added just because I had to search a lot
    to find them and thought they might be useful:
    	
	To make screenshots of your MDM screen: edit "/etc/mdm/Init/Default"
	 and add:
	 
					( gnome-screenshot -d 5) &
	
	before the line with "exit 0"
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To change GDM background user color (in Linux Mint) go to: 
                     
                     user/share/mdm/distro.conf  
                     
    file and change line 5 (GTKTheme=) to what ever other GTK theme you 
    want and it will change the color of the GDM user color to match it.   
       
  --------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
To change the dialogue on the menu and the trash
	
	(i.e.: "add to panel, add to desktop, add to favorites, uninstall"; 
	go to: 
	
	usr/share/cinnamon/applets/menu@cinnamon.org (line234, between the 
	parenthesis. Example:
	                                                          	
	menuItem = new ApplicationContextMenuItem(this, _("add to panel"), "add_to_panel");) 
													  	^^^^^^^^^^^
													  	CHANGE HERE 
	The rest of the options, (desktop,favorite, and uninstall), are just 
	below this													  	
													  	
	
	At line 2003 you can change the dialogue for the "start" "logout" 
	and "lock computer" buttons.	
						
	And to change the Trash dialogue; line 12 of:
			
			usr/share/cinnamon/applets/trash@cinnamon.org
	
	and edit the .js file the dialogue you want.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Miscellaneous things:
    
    Know all your O/S & hardware:
    
		inxi -Fx
			
	clean house:
	
		sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get autoremove
		sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
	
	System shutdown:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
    And finally, just for laughs, there is a set of original wallpapers 
    thrown in too. Feel free to throw them out, too! That is the beauty
    of Linux, the freedom to do as you want with the OS. Feel free to
    cherry-pick anything in here you want and alter away, and make 
    something new out of it and claim it as your own! After all, that's
    what Linux is for. 
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    I hope you enjoy this work of mine. Please UP vote it when you can!
    
    If you have any problems with installation or performance, feel free
    to contact me through my profile at Gnome-look.org and I will 
    address your concerns as soon as possible, and if I can't answer 
    your problem, I will certainly try to point you to an answer. 
    
    Please be aware; however, that I use Linux Mint Cinnamon, and have 
    exclusively since my conversion from M$, (it was the distro I picked 
    out of the list on distro watch; after testing a few, I found my 
    true love...), and my knowledge outside of the Ubuntu / Debian 
    world is limited and fairly useless. So it would be pointless to ask 
    me distro specific questions such as, "how to port this to KDE, 
    xfce, MATE, etc.?" (I know... I should get out more! ...but it's a 
    great comfort zone I don't feel like leaving. It just works for me, 
    and is everything I ever wanted in an OS. I am a Linux Mint fanboy 
    fer sure...)

	A GUI is only as good as its maker, a CLI is only as good as its user.
